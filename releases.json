These paramters were chosen through analysis of the results of Experiments 1 through 10. Max F1 (threshold = 1.649) was 0.906 on the validation set and 0.897 on the test set. AUROC was 0.934 on the validation set and 0.921 on the test set. AUPR was 0.957 on the validation set and 0.939 on the test set. When evaluated against the TAC gold standard, the model achieves: F1=0.877, AUROC=0.917, and AUPR=0.936. Using the official eval script from TAC, the Macro-F1 is 84.98.
