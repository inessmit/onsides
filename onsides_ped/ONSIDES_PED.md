# OnSIDES-PED

Here, we generate databases mirroring the OnSIDES and OnSIDES-INTL databases, but focused on adverse drug events specifically noted for pediatric patients. We follow a similar ADE extraction/prediction philosophy to OnSIDES, but the technical workflow has been adapted slightly to accomodate extracting the ADE terms from the "Special Populations" sections of drug labels. The notebooks to generate the OnSIDES-PED from the FDA drug labels are in the [notebooks](./notebooks/) folder, and the notebooks for OnSIDES-INTL can be found in the respective subfolders in the [OnSIDES-INTL](onsides_intl) folder.

If you are interested in how the primary OnSIDES database (FDA drug labels) is generated, please refer to the main [OnSIDES](https://github.com/tatonetti-lab/onsides/blob/main/DATABASE.md) page.
