# OnSIDES-INTL Database Generation Walkthrough

Here, we generate databases mirroring the OnSIDES database (which extracts ADE data from US FDA SPL drug labels) from UK (EMC), EU (EMA), and Japan (PMDA) drug labels. 

While we follow a similar adverse-drug-event extraction/evaluation philosophy to OnSIDES, as the raw label are formatted in a slightly different manner for each nation/region, we will describe the process of generating the databases by the individual nation. Please skip to the details for the specific database you are interested in. 

If you are interested in how the OnSIDES database extracted from US FDA drug labels is generated, please refer to [OnSIDES](https://github.com/tatonetti-lab/onsides/blob/main/DATABASE.md)
